# skewnlmm

This repository contains the R codes for fitting a nonlinear mixed-effects models with scale mixture of skew-normal distributios, which is discussed in the following work:
Schumacher, F. L., Dey, D. K., Lachos, V. H. (2020) Approximate inferences for nonlinear mixed effects models with scalemixtures of skewâ€“normal distributions. Preprint will be available soon.

The file **"theoph-SMSN-NLME.R"** presents an application of the method for analysing the *theoph* data set, and gives some instructions for applications in general.

The R package skewlmm (available at CRAN and Github) is the linear version of the model, and its documentation might be helpful.
